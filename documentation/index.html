        <h4>XML Implementation for Catalog Page Slots</h4>
        <p>
          On my Catalog Page, I've implemented a feature that makes it easier to access item details using XML. I've created a function called <strong>showItemInfo(itemName)</strong> which allows me to fetch information such as item description and price directly from an XML file named <strong>example_data.xml</strong>. When I use this function with the name of the item I'm interested in, it locates the relevant details in the XML file and updates the modal on the page accordingly. If there are any issues with fetching the XML data, I've made sure to display simple error messages to keep things smooth for the user. This integration has made it easy for me to provide detailed information about items right from the catalog page.

        <h4>GitHub Deployment with DNS Integration</h4>
        <p>
          To get my website online, I turned to a DNS provider for hosting and utilized <a style="color: red;" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jam0038/sat">GitHub</a> for code management. Uploading my code to GitHub allowed easy editing and collaboration. Then, with the help of the DNS provider, I deployed my website online without any cost.

        <h4>Extensions used</h4>
        <p>
          I've simplified my development process by using different extensions. One handy extension I rely on is called "<strong>Live Server</strong>." It helps me by launching a local development server with a live reload feature for both static and dynamic pages. This extension has been a game-changer, making my development work smoother and more efficient.
